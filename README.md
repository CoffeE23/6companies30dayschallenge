# 6 Companies 30 Days Challenge
In this challenge, every 5 days you'll be give 15 questions that are most frequently or recently asked in a MNC and the goal is to complete those questions within the span of 5 days. After every 5 days new 15 questions will be given of another MNC and in this way this challenge will help you to prepare for 6 MNCs. You can upload the code on github or linkedin. I am starting this challenge to have a productive start of the new year. All the best to all.
